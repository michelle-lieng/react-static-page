# ðŸ§  React Fun Facts

This is my **first React app**, built as part of the [Scrimba Learn React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04&t=495s).  
It's a simple static page that displays a list of fun facts about React using reusable components and basic CSS styling.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this mini project was to practice:

- Writing JSX
- Creating functional components (`Navbar`, `MainContent`, `Footer`)
- Styling a React app

The result is a fun, clean-looking page that introduces some cool facts about React!

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome

I learned how to:

- Set up a React app with Vite
- Organize my UI using components
- Use Flexbox and gradients for layout and styling
- Embed images in React

## ðŸ“¸ Demo Comparison
